The "Coffee Machine" is a Python console application that simulates the functionality of a real coffee vending machine. Users can choose from three different types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The program manages resources, processes payments, and keeps track of profits.

Gameplay Features:

1) Menu and Resources: The application has a predefined menu with recipes and resource requirements for each coffee type.
2) Resource Management: The machine keeps track of the available resources (water, milk, and coffee) and checks if there are sufficient ingredients to make the chosen coffee.
3) Coin Processing: The machine processes coins inserted by the user and calculates the total amount received.
4) Transaction Handling: The machine checks if the inserted amount is sufficient to cover the cost of the coffee. If successful, it updates the profit and returns any change.
5) Coffee Making: If the transaction is successful and resources are sufficient, the machine deducts the used ingredients from the resources and serves the coffee.
6) User Commands: Users can turn off the machine, request a resource report, or order a coffee.
